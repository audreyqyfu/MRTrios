Description: Genomic trios each consisting of copy number alteration (CNA), methylation, and gene expression are formed based on gene names and their Entrez IDs, using the TCGA data. It then performs causal network inference with mendelian randomization to each trio, including confounders, and infers a regulatory model for each trio.
